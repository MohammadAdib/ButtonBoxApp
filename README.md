# ButtonBoxApp

ButtonBox is an app for Sim Racers to control their gaming experience through the phone by simulating keyboard key presses. Works with any sim, or game.

ButtonBox uses UDP to connect the devices together. The app has a built in repetitive 10 second heartbeat to check for connectivity with servers. Auto-discovery is possible as both the app and server have a UDP client and server passing ack's back and forth. Future plans to expand this might include integration with real-time telemetry from games like Assetto Corsa
